A Discord/Slack bot that relays messages posted by IFTTT Applet for Google Calendar notifications.

<b>Prerequisites:</b>
- Google account for Google Calendar.
- IFTTT account with Google Calendar and Slack authorized.
- A Slack account with a workspace for the bot to be on.
- A Discord account with a bot in a shared server.

<b>Introduction:</b>

![IFTTT Applet Display](https://i.imgur.com/pfbl3xM.png "Much of this notification is dependent on the IFTTT applet.")

The bot will break or not display the information if it is not in that order or style. I was trying to keep the bot small and manageable as it's only job is to listen and transfer notifications. The message is then sent into the Slack DMs where it is processed into a Discord embed and transferred into your shared DMs on Discord for the event notification. Yes, you will get Slack notifications as well, but those can be turned off or ignored.
